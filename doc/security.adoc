[[security]]
== Security

Built into the library, [yada]#yada# offers a complete standards-based set of ((security)) features for today's secure applications and content delivery.

In [yada]#yada#, resources are self-contained and are individually protected from unauthorized access:

[quote,RFC 7231 Section 2]
____
One design goal of HTTP is to separate resource identification from request semantics.
____

Security is part of the semantics of a resource, so is part of resource itself, rather than coupled to the URI and routing. This approach improves the https://en.wikipedia.org/Cohesion_(computer_science)[cohesion] of the web resource, which can be tested independently.

As in all other areas, [yada]#yada# aims for 100% compliance with core HTTP standards when it comes to security, notably https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235[RFC 7235]. Also, since HTTP APIs are nowadays used to facilitate transactional integration between systems via the user's browser, it is important that [yada]#yada# fully supports systems that offer APIs to other applications, across origins, as standardised by http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[CORS].

Security aspects for a resource are specified in its model's
`:access-control` entry.

NOTE: Depending on your use-case, you may decide to create this map
independently and merge it into groups of yada resource maps. In
[yada]#yada#, it is typical to see resource maps created
programmatically--they are just maps of data after all.

It is worth taking some time to understand what is involved in
processing an HTTP request in [yada]#yada# that relate to
authentication and authorization. <<figure-security-flow>> shows a
simplified portion of the sequence of steps.

<1> First, the values of declared _parameters_ (query, path, header, form
& body) are taken from the request and checked for validity. These
parameters may be used later, both in the identification of the user
and the resource being addressed. Invalid parameters would cause a
response with a `400 Bad Request` status.

<2> Next, the request is authenticated according to an _authentication
scheme_. This involves inspecting the request for claims about the
identity of the user (and verifying that these claims are genuine and
trustworthy). Unless there is something suspicious about the request's
claims, such as the detection of a forgery attempt, *no decision is
made at this stage about whether the request should be accepted or
rejected*.

<3> Next, the resource's _properties_ are determined, such as
existence, last modification time and, in particular, attributes
governing ownership and required access conditions. These may be
ascertained solely from the request or might involve one or more
requests to other sources, such as databases.

<4> After this, an _authorization_ step is carried out to determine
whether the credentials carried by the request, if any, are sufficient
to allow access to the resource. If not, a response is returned with a
401 or 403 status code--a `401 Unauthorized` if no credentials are
present, and a `403 Forbidden` if they are. A 401 gives the user-agent
the hint that it should attempt to capture authentication data from
the user and retry the request.

<5> The request processing proceeds. Any response generated may depend
on information established by these steps. For example, certain
information might be filtered out of a response to requests that don't
have sufficient authorization.

Note that this design supports all of the following cases:

. A resource is publicly accessible.

. A resource is publicly accessible but is rendered differently for a
authenticated user.

. A resource cannot be accessed without authentication.

. A resource cannot be accessed without authentication and the user
having sufficient access rights.

.A tale of two bank accounts
****
To understand the reasons why requests are processed in this way,
here's a practical example.

Imagine tasked with the problem of securing a banking website.

A bank has decided that the URL for accessing account balance
information should be
\https://bigbank.com/accounts/<account-number>/balances.html.

All requests are checked to ensure that the request is from a properly
logged-in user.

Let's say Alice's bank account number is 12345678. By this design, as
long as Alice is logged in, Alice can access her account balance via a
GET request to \https://bigbank.com/accounts/12345678/balances.html.

_Can you spot a security issue here?_

The problem is that Alice can also access Bob's bank account balances.

This may seem like an obvious mistake but this type of vulnerability
has historically been extremely common and responsible for a great
many hacks footnote:[It is surprising that the simple editing of a URL
in the browser by the user should be considered 'hacking' at all]. It
is still a common contributor to OWASP 2017's #5 most critical
security issue:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control[Broken
Access Control].

One of the causes is that many web frameworks don't provide good
support for this example use-case, and still rely on declaratively
security on the URL itself. This is another reason why it's important
to understand security in terms of a resource rather than a URI
pattern. It's only once you have fully identified a web resource that
you can determine whether access to it should be granted to a request.

[[realms]]
=== Realms

In HTTP, resources can exist inside a _protection space_ determined by
one or more __realms__. Each resource declares the realm (or realms) it
is protected by, as part of the *:access-control* entry of its
resource-model.

[yada]#yada# supports multiple realms. By default, there is a single
realm in operation, named `default`. However, you can group multiple
authentication schemes together with an authorization model into a
separate realm. Note each realm can contain multiple authentication
schemes (it might be that a realm offers a choice of how to
authenticate).

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
  {:realms
    {"Gondor" {:authentication-schemes […]
               :authorization {…}}
     "Mordor" {:authentication-schemes {…}
               :authorization {…}}}}}
----

[[authentication-schemes]]
=== Authentication

[.lead]
Authentication is the act of establishing the credentials of a user,
by checking the claims in the request.

As has already been explained, the act of authentication alone does
not approve or deny the request--that requires the act of
_authorization_ which is covered in <<authorization, the next
section>>.

Each <<realms,realm>> declares one or more _authentication
schemes_. An authentication scheme determines how the request's
credentials are established. Credentials contain information such as
the user's identity, roles and privileges, which can be used to deny
the request, or if approved, may affect the nature of the response.

[yada]#yada# supports a number of built-in authentication schemes
(Basic, Digest, Cookie, JWT) and also allows for custom authentication
schemes.

Here is an example of a custom authentication scheme:

[source,clojure]
----
{:scheme "my-authentication-scheme" <1>
 :authenticate (fn [ctx] {:user "Alice"}) <2>
}
----
<1> The scheme name.
<2> An `authenticate` function, which is optional. For illustrative purposes, this one simply returns a map containing "Alice".

The scheme name can be a keyword but if it's a string in will be used in a `WWW-Authenticate` header value in the event of a `401 Unauthorized` response (authorization is covered later in <<authorization>>).

The `:authenticate` function, if present, will specify a function that will be invoked with the [yada]#yada# context and should return credentials (which can be anything, but usually a map). Returning `nil` from this function indicates that the request contains no credentials, which determines whether a 401 or 403 is returned later if the authorization check fails.

If the `:authenticate` function is missing, the authentication method
will be determined by the scheme, via the `yada.security/verify`
multimethod. These might be built-in or methods provided by yada
extensions (or user-code) via Clojure's `defmethod`.

[[authorization]]
=== Authorization

[.lead]
Authorization is the act of allowing a user access to a resource.

This may require knowledge about the user only (for example, in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control[Role-based
access control]) or may (additionally) depend on properties of the
resource identified by the HTTP request's URI (as part of an
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control[Attribute-based
access control] authorization scheme). In either case, we assume that
the user has already been authenticated, and we are confident that
their credentials are genuine.

In [yada]#yada#, the resource's properties are determined prior to the
authorization step, since it may be necessary to use these properties
in the authorization decision.

==== Custom authorization with a validate function

A custom authorization scheme can be provided by specifying a
`validate` function, which takes the [yada]#yada# context and the credentials established in the realm during the authentication step:

[source,clojure]
----
:authorization {:validate (fn [ctx creds] …)}
----

If the authorization succeeds, the `validate` function must return
the [yada]#yada# context, possibly augmented to provide extra data
that can might be needed when generating the response.

If the request should be rejected, the `validate` function should
return `nil` or `false`. Either a `401 Unauthorized` response will
then be returned to the user-agent (in the case that no authentication
claims were sent with the request) or a `403 Forbidden` (in the case
that they were).

It is a common case for a resource to require a valid logged-in
user. This is easy to implement:

[source,clojure]
----
:authorization {:validate (fn [ctx creds] (when creds ctx))}
----

==== Custom authorization with a defmethod

As an alternative to specifying a function, a global custom
authorization scheme can be defined via a `defmethod`.

CAUTION: This is no longer a recommended approach and exists solely
for reasons of compatibility with previous [yada]#yada# releases, see
<<sidebar-function-or-defmethod>>

First, decide on a keyword that will be used to dispatch your
authorization function. In this example, we've chosen
`:my/custom-authorization`.

Now declare the authorization function that will be called by
[yada]#yada# during request processing. This is a `defmethod`, as
follows:

[source,clojure]
----
(defmethod yada.authorization/validate
  :my/custom-authorization
  [ctx credentials authorization]
…
)
----

The credentials argument contains all the verified credentials sent in
the request.

Now add an `:authorization` map to the `:access-control` part of your
resource model. The map must contain a `:scheme` value specific to your
resource model, along with any extra parameters you want to be passed as
the `authorization` argument to your authorization function. In this
example, we want to pass the `:my/ensure` parameter set to
`[:same-account]`. You can specify anything you like to be passed as
parameters (there are no schema restrictions here).

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
 {:authorization
  {:scheme :my/custom-authorization
   :my/ensure [:same-account]}}}
----

[[sidebar-function-or-defmethod]]
.Which should I choose: function or defmethod?
****
Given these two alternatives to custom authorization, which one should you choose?

Earlier versions of [yada]#yada# only provided the `defmethod` way of
providing your own code, both for authorization and authentication.

The problem with a `defmethod` is that it exists at the top-level of a
namespace and cannot access surrounding lexical scope. That makes it
hard to access resources such as databases that might be required by
the authentication and authorization steps.

One popular workaround was to inject database connections into the
yada context via a custom interceptor at the beginning of the
chain. However, this has provied a tricky, cumbersome and error-prone
approach.

Functions are therefore recommeded rather than the `defmethod`
approach.

[[basic-authentication]]
=== Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is supported by all web browsers and serves as a
quick way of securing a resource. Basic Authentication is defined in
https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt[RFC 2617].

<<example-basic-authentication>> shows a resource that is protected with Basic Authentication.

[[example-basic-authentication]]
.Basic Authentication
====
Assume we have a map of users:

[source,clojure]
----
{"alice" {:yada.example-auth/name "Alice Roberts"
          :yada.example-auth/password "Seeshai6"}
 "bob2" {:yada.example-auth/name "Bob Mortimer"
         :yada.example-auth/password "bohthoM6"}}
----

The function below creates a [yada]#yada# resource. The function takes
the map of users an argument and returns a resource which will be
accessible only via successful authentication.

[source,clojure]
----
(ns yada.example-auth
  (:require [yada.yada :as yada]))

(defn basic-auth-example-resource [users]
  (yada/resource
   {:access-control
    {:realms
     {"default"
      {:authentication-schemes
       [{:scheme "Basic" ; <1>
         :verify
         (fn [[user-id given-password]]
           (when-let [user (get users user-id)]
             (when (= given-password (::password user))
               {::user (dissoc user ::password)})))}] ; <2>
       :authorization
       {:validate
        (fn [ctx creds]
	  (when creds ctx))}}}} ; <3>

    :methods
    {:get
     {:produces
      {:media-type "text/plain" :charset "utf8"}
      :response
      (fn [ctx]
        (format
         "Welcome %s" ; <4>
         (-> ctx :authentication (get "default") ::user ::name)))}}}))
----
<1> The :scheme is declared as `"Basic"`
<2> If the user and password match, a map is returned containing the credentials (in this case, the map representing the user, minus the password)
<3> If credentials exist, the authorization step succeeds.
<4> The user's name is generated in the response body.

[[how-basic-auth-works]]
.How Basic authentication works
****
Let's take a moment to dig a bit deeper into the implementation of this method:

[source,clojure]
----
include::../src/yada/security.clj[tag=verify-basic]
----
<1> Note the multimethod is dispatched on the value of `:scheme`, and the `verify` function extracted.
<2> The `Authorization` header is extracted from the request, via a regular expresssion.
<3> The base64-encoded credentials are extracted.
<4> The `verify` function is called with the decoded `user` and `password` values.

Note that the implementation does much of the heavy-lifting so that the `verify` function can be easier to implement.

[[digest-authentication]]
==== Digest authentication

(coming soon)

[[cookie-authentication]]
==== Cookie authentication

We can also use cookies to present authentication credentials. The
advantage of cookies is that they can be set by the server based on
custom authentication interaction with the user, such as the submission
of a login-form.

To protect a site with cookies:

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
  {:scheme :cookie
   :cookie "session"
   :verify (fn [cookie] …}}
----

[[jwt-authentication]]
==== JWT authentication

(coming soon)

[[form-based-logins]]
==== Form-based logins

Basic Authentication has a number of weaknesses, such as the difficulty
of logging out and the lack of control that a website has over the
fields presented to a human. Therefore, the vast majority of websites
prefer to use a custom login form generated in HTML.

You can think of a login form as a resource that lets the user present
one set of credentials in order to acquire additional ones. The
credentials the user presents, via a form, are verified and if they are
true, a cookie is generated that certifies this. This cookie provides
the certification to subsequent requests in which it is sent.

Let's start by building this login resource that will provide a login
form page to browsers and verify the form data when that form is
submitted.

Here's a simplistic but viable resource model for the two methods
involved:

[source,clojure]
----
(require
 '[buddy.sign.jwt :as jwt]
 '[schema.core :as s]
 '[hiccup.core :refer [html])

{:methods
 {:post
  {:consumes "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   :parameters {:form
                {:user s/Str :password s/Str}}

   :response
   (fn [ctx]
     (let [{:keys [user password]} (get-in ctx [:parameters :form])]
       (if (valid-user user password)
         (assoc (:response ctx)
                :cookies {"session"
                          {:value
                           (jwt/sign {:user user} "lp0fTc2JMtx8")}})
         "Try again!")))}
  :get
  {:produces "text/html"
   :response (html
              [:form {:method :post}
               [:input {:name "user" :type :text}]
               [:input {:name "password" :type :password}]
               [:input {:type :submit}]])}}}
----

The POST method method consumes incoming URL-encoded data (the classic
way a browser sends form data). It de-structures the two parameters
(user and password) from the form parameters.

We then determine if the user and password are valid (we don't explain
here how this is done, but assume a `valid-user` function exists that
can tell us). If the user is valid we associate a new cookie called
"session" with the response. By starting with the `:response` value of
the request context, we ensure [yada]#yada# interprets our return value as a
Ring response rather than some other value.

We use Buddy's `sign` function to sign and encoded the cookie's value as
a JSON string. We only specify the credentials as `{:user user}` in this
case, but we could put much more into that map. The `sign` function
requires us to provide a secret symmetric key that we can use for both
signing and verification, but the library does allow us asymmetric key
options too.

The other method, GET, simply produces a form for user-agents that can
render HTML (browsers, typically) to post back. For reasons of cohesion,
it's a good idea to provide these two methods in the same resource to
encapsulate and dedupe the fields which are relevant to both the GET and
the POST.

[[logout]]
==== Logout

The recommended way of logging out is to remove the session.

[[bearer-authentication-oauth2]]
==== Bearer authentication (OAuth2)

(coming soon)

[[multifactor-authentication]]
==== Multifactor authentication

(coming soon)




[[default-authorization-scheme]]
==== Built-in role-based authorization

By default, [yada]#yada# will use a declarative role-based authorization scheme.

Any method can be protected by declaring a role or set of roles in its
model.

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
 {:authorization
  {:methods
   {:post :accounts/create-transaction}}}}
----

If multiple roles are involved, they can be composed inside vectors
using simple predicate logic.

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
 {:authorization
  {:methods
   {:post [:or [:and :accounts/user
                     :accounts/create-transaction]
               :superuser}}}}
----

Only the simple boolean 'operators' of `:and`, `:or` and `:not` are
allowed in this authorization scheme. This keeps the role definitions
declarative and easy to extract and process by other tooling.

Of course, authentication information is available in the request
context when a method is invoked, so any method may apply its own custom
authorization logic as necessary. However, [yada]#yada# encourages developers to
adopt a declarative approach to resources wherever possible, to maximise
the integration opportunities with other libraries and tools.













[[cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors]]
=== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

[yada]#yada# fully supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allowing you to
provide APIs that are accessible from other origins.

For example, you may be creating an API that you wish other websites to
make use of, by allowing browsers visiting those websites access to your
API.

CORS is specified in the `:access-control` section of the
resource-model.

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
 {:allow-origin "*"
  :allow-credentials false
  :expose-headers #{"X-Custom"}
  :allow-methods #{:get :post}
  :allow-headers ["Api-Key"]
 }}
----

With the exception of `:allow-credentials` (which must be a boolean),
any of the values can be declared as single-arity functions, which are
called with the request-context as an argument to determine the value
for the corresponding response header.

[[http-strict-transport-security-hsts]]
=== HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

`clojure {:strict-transport-security {:max-age 12000}}`

Defaults to a maximum age of 31536000.

The HSTS header is only set if the scheme is HTTPS or the service is
behind a proxy (determined by the presence of the `X-Forwarded-For`
request header).

[[content-security-policy]]
=== Content Security Policy

[source,clojure]
----
{:content-security-policy "url-src"}
----

Defaults to `default-src https: data: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'`.

[[clickjacking-prevention]]
=== Clickjacking prevention

A browser's iframe can be used for 'click-jacking'. By default [yada]#yada#
tells browsers not to allow this. The default value is `SAMEORIGIN`,
unless you override it in the resource-model.

[source,clojure]
----
{:x-frame-options "NONE"}
----

[[cross-site-scripting-xss-protection]]
=== Cross-site Scripting (XSS) protection

[yada]#yada# also sets the `X-Xss-Protection` response header to
`1; mode=block`. This can be overridden in the resource model.

[source,clojure]
----
{:x-content-type-options "0"}
----

[[media-type-sniffing-protection]]
=== Media-type sniffing protection

By default, [yada]#yada# sets the `X-Content-Type-Options` response header to
`nosniff`. This tells browsers not to try to attempt to determine the
content-type of the response body.

Since [yada]#yada# sets the `Content-Type` header according to HTTP standards,
there should never be a need for a browser to 'sniff' the response body
for this information, preventing an attack that might exploit some
vulnerability in this process.
