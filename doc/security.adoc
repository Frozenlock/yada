[[security]]
== Security

Built into the library, [yada]#yada# offers a complete standards-based set of ((security)) features for today's secure applications and content delivery.

In [yada]#yada#, resources are self-contained and are individually protected from unauthorized access:

[quote,RFC 7231 Section 2]
____
One design goal of HTTP is to separate resource identification from request semantics.
____

Security is part of the semantics of a resource, so is part of resource itself, rather than coupled to the URI and routing. This approach improves the https://en.wikipedia.org/Cohesion_(computer_science)[cohesion] of the web resource, which can be tested independently.

As in all other areas, [yada]#yada# aims for 100% compliance with core HTTP standards when it comes to security, notably https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235[RFC 7235]. Also, since HTTP APIs are nowadays used to facilitate transactional integration between systems via the user's browser, it is important that [yada]#yada# fully supports systems that offer APIs to other applications, across origins, as standardised by http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[CORS].

It is worth taking some time to understand what is involved in
processing an HTTP request in [yada]#yada# that relate to
authentication and authorization. <<figure-security-flow>> shows a
simplified portion of the sequence of steps.

<1> First, the values of declared _parameters_ (query, path, header, form
& body) are taken from the request and checked for validity. These
parameters may be used later, both in the identification of the user
and the resource being addressed. Invalid parameters would cause a
response with a `400 Bad Request` status.

<2> Next, the request is authenticated according to an _authentication
scheme_. This involves inspecting the request for claims about the
identity of the user (and verifying that these claims are genuine and
trustworthy). Unless there is something suspicious about the request's
claims, such as the detection of a forgery attempt, *no decision is
made at this stage about whether the request should be accepted or
rejected*.

<3> Next, the resource's _properties_ are determined, such as
existence, last modification time and, in particular, attributes
governing ownership and required access conditions. These may be
ascertained solely from the request or might involve one or more
requests to other sources, such as databases.

<4> After this, an _authorization_ step is carried out to determine
whether the credentials carried by the request, if any, are sufficient
to allow access to the resource. If not, a response is returned with a
401 or 403 status code--a `401 Unauthorized` if no credentials are
present, and a `403 Forbidden` if they are. A 401 gives the user-agent
the hint that it should attempt to capture authentication data from
the user and retry the request.

<5> The request processing proceeds. Any response generated may depend
on information established by these steps. For example, certain
information might be filtered out of a response to requests that don't
have sufficient authorization.

Note that this design supports all of the following cases:

. A resource is publicly accessible.

. A resource is publicly accessible but is rendered differently for a
authenticated user.

. A resource cannot be accessed without authentication.

. A resource cannot be accessed without authentication and the user
having sufficient access rights.

.A tale of two bank accounts
****
To understand the reasons why requests are processed in this way,
here's a practical example.

Imagine tasked with the problem of securing a banking website.

A bank has decided that the URL for accessing account balance
information should be
\https://bigbank.com/accounts/<account-number>/balances.html.

All requests are checked to ensure that the request is from a properly
logged-in user.

Let's say Alice's bank account number is 12345678. By this design, as
long as Alice is logged in, Alice can access her account balance via a
GET request to \https://bigbank.com/accounts/12345678/balances.html.

_Can you spot a security issue here?_

The problem is that Alice can also access Bob's bank account balances.

This may seem like an obvious mistake but this type of vulnerability
has historically been extremely common and responsible for a great
many hacks footnote:[It is surprising that the simple editing of a URL
in the browser by the user should be considered 'hacking' at all]. It
is still a common contributor to OWASP 2017's #5 most critical
security issue:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control[Broken
Access Control].

One of the causes is that many web frameworks don't provide good
support for this example use-case, and still rely on declarative
security on the URL itself. This is another reason why it's important
to understand security in terms of a resource rather than a URI
pattern. It's only once you have fully identified a web resource that
you can determine whether access to it should be granted to a request.

[[authentication-schemes]]
=== HTTP Authentication

[.lead]
In HTTP, authentication is the act of establishing the credentials of a user,
by checking the claims made in the `Authorization` header of the request.

Authentication is achieved by declaring one (or more) _authentication
schemes_ on the resource. An authentication scheme determines how the
request's credentials are established. Credentials contain information
such as the user's identity, roles and privileges, which can be used
to deny the request, or if approved, may affect the nature of the
response. IANA maintains a
link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-authschemes/http-authschemes.xhtml[registry]
of HTTP authentication schemes, which include
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617[Basic],
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7616[Digest],
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750[Bearer],
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7486[HOBA] and others.

<<example-basic-auth>> demonstrates how a resource might be protected
using Basic Authentication.

[[example-basic-auth]]
.Protecting a [yada]#yada# resource with Basic Authentication
====
To declare a resource will be protected with Basic Authentication:

[source,clojure]
----
include::../dev/src/yada/dev/examples.clj[tag=basic]
----
<1> The resource contains an`:authentication` entry
<2> The scheme is set to `Basic`
<3> Any non-blank user is considered a success. Real-world cases would most likely check the password too.
<4> A value is returned that will be bound as the context's `:authentication` entry.
<5> Optionally, a realm value can be specified. The support for, and semantics of a realm value depends on the authentication scheme.
<6> The response to a GET request prints a string containing the user field.
====

Other authentication schemes work in a similar way to that shown in <<example-basic-auth>>.

==== The `:authenticate` function

The `:authenticate` function takes 3 arguments:

* the [yada]#yada# context.
* the credentials found in the value of the request's `Authorization header`. For some schemes, this is pre-processed for convenience. For example, in the case of Basic Authentication, the header is decoded into a vector containing the user and password sent by the user-agent.
* the value of the authentication scheme, allowing for extra data to be specified on a per-resource basis.

The `:authenticate` function MUST return one of the following:

* A truthy value, indicating successful authentication, which will be bound to the [yada]#yada# context as the `:authentication` entry.
* Nil, indicating authentication has not be satisfied, for example, due to a bad password or illegal submission. No `:authentication` entry is bound to the [yada]#yada# context.
* The [yada]#yada# context, augmented as appropriate with a `:authentication` entry.
* Partial credentials, with a new authentication scheme to try (TBD)

Return values from the `:authenticate` function MAY be
https://github.com/ztellman/manifold/blob/master/docs/deferred.md[deferred]
values. Since authentication often involves database or network calls it can be made asychronous to avoid blocking the request thread.

==== Multiple authentication schemes

If a resource has multiple authentication schemes, use the
`:authentication-schemes` entry instead, with a collection of auth
schemes.

[source,clojure]
----
{
 :authentication-schemes
 [{:scheme "Basic" …}
  {:scheme "Digest" …}]
}
----

Challenges will be sent to the user-agent with each possible scheme,
allowing the user-agent to pick the best one.


[[authorization]]
=== Authorization

[.lead]
Authorization is the act of allowing a user access to a resource.

This may require knowledge about the user only (for example, in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control[Role-based
access control]) or may (additionally) depend on properties of the
resource identified by the HTTP request's URI (as part of an
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control[Attribute-based
access control] authorization scheme). In either case, we assume that
the user has already been authenticated, and we are confident that
their credentials are genuine.

In [yada]#yada#, the resource's properties are determined prior to the
authorization step, since it may be necessary to use these properties
in the authorization decision.

Authorization can be declared on a resource using an `:authorization` entry:

[source,clojure]
----
{
  :authorization
  {:authorize (fn [ctx authentication _]
                …)
   :custom/data 123}
}
----

==== The `:authorize` function

The `:authorize` function takes 3 arguments:

* the [yada]#yada# context.
* the `:authentication` entry of the [yada]#yada# context -- this can be established by an `:authenticate` function or other means.
* the authorization entry, which might contain extra declared data on a per-resource basis which may be used in determining the authorization.

The `:authorize` function MUST return one of the following:

* A truthy value, indicating successful authorization, which will be bound to the [yada]#yada# context as the `:authorization` entry.
* Nil, indicating access will not be granted to the resource. No `:authorization` entry is bound to the [yada]#yada# context.
* The [yada]#yada# context, augmented as appropriate with a `:authorization` entry.

==== Default authorization

If no `:authorize` function is specified then, by default, the following rules are applied:

* If there are no authentication schemes declared on the resource, access is granted.
* If there is at least one authentication scheme, and no credentials have been supplied, then access is denied.

==== Shorthand

If no extra data beyond the `:authorize` function needs to be declared, then as a shorthand, the `:authorize` function can be specifed at the top-level:

[source,clojure]
----
{
  :authorize (fn [ctx creds] …)
}
----

Since there is no extra authorization data in this case, the function
only takes two arguments, since the third argument is not needed.


=== State management

NOTE: This section is currently being revised.

[[form-based-logins]]
==== Form-based logins

Basic Authentication has a number of weaknesses, such as the difficulty
of logging out and the lack of control that a website has over the
fields presented to a human. Therefore, the vast majority of websites
prefer to use a custom login form generated in HTML.

You can think of a login form as a resource that lets the user present
one set of credentials in order to acquire additional ones. The
credentials the user presents, via a form, are verified and if they are
true, a cookie is generated that certifies this. This cookie provides
the certification to subsequent requests in which it is sent.

Let's start by building this login resource that will provide a login
form page to browsers and verify the form data when that form is
submitted.

Here's a simplistic but viable resource model for the two methods
involved:

[source,clojure]
----
(require
 '[buddy.sign.jwt :as jwt]
 '[schema.core :as s]
 '[hiccup.core :refer [html])

{:methods
 {:post
  {:consumes "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   :parameters {:form
                {:user s/Str :password s/Str}}

   :response
   (fn [ctx]
     (let [{:keys [user password]} (get-in ctx [:parameters :form])]
       (if (valid-user user password)
         (assoc (:response ctx)
                :cookies {"session"
                          {:value
                           (jwt/sign {:user user} "lp0fTc2JMtx8")}})
         "Try again!")))}
  :get
  {:produces "text/html"
   :response (html
              [:form {:method :post}
               [:input {:name "user" :type :text}]
               [:input {:name "password" :type :password}]
               [:input {:type :submit}]])}}}
----

The POST method method consumes incoming URL-encoded data (the classic
way a browser sends form data). It de-structures the two parameters
(user and password) from the form parameters.

We then determine if the user and password are valid (we don't explain
here how this is done, but assume a `valid-user` function exists that
can tell us). If the user is valid we associate a new cookie called
"session" with the response. By starting with the `:response` value of
the request context, we ensure [yada]#yada# interprets our return value as a
Ring response rather than some other value.

We use Buddy's `sign` function to sign and encoded the cookie's value as
a JSON string. We only specify the credentials as `{:user user}` in this
case, but we could put much more into that map. The `sign` function
requires us to provide a secret symmetric key that we can use for both
signing and verification, but the library does allow us asymmetric key
options too.

The other method, GET, simply produces a form for user-agents that can
render HTML (browsers, typically) to post back. For reasons of cohesion,
it's a good idea to provide these two methods in the same resource to
encapsulate and dedupe the fields which are relevant to both the GET and
the POST.

[[logout]]
===== Logout

The recommended way of logging out is to remove the session.

[[cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors]]
=== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

[yada]#yada# fully supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allowing you to
provide APIs that are accessible from other origins.

For example, you may be creating an API that you wish other websites to
make use of, by allowing browsers visiting those websites access to your
API.

CORS is specified in the `:access-control` section of the
resource-model.

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
 {:allow-origin "*"
  :allow-credentials false
  :expose-headers #{"X-Custom"}
  :allow-methods #{:get :post}
  :allow-headers ["Api-Key"]
 }}
----

With the exception of `:allow-credentials` (which must be a boolean),
any of the values can be declared as single-arity functions, which are
called with the request-context as an argument to determine the value
for the corresponding response header.

[[http-strict-transport-security-hsts]]
=== HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

`clojure {:strict-transport-security {:max-age 12000}}`

Defaults to a maximum age of 31536000.

The HSTS header is only set if the scheme is HTTPS or the service is
behind a proxy (determined by the presence of the `X-Forwarded-For`
request header).

[[content-security-policy]]
=== Content Security Policy

[source,clojure]
----
{:content-security-policy "url-src"}
----

Defaults to `default-src https: data: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'`.

[[clickjacking-prevention]]
=== Clickjacking prevention

A browser's iframe can be used for 'click-jacking'. By default [yada]#yada#
tells browsers not to allow this. The default value is `SAMEORIGIN`,
unless you override it in the resource-model.

[source,clojure]
----
{:x-frame-options "NONE"}
----

[[cross-site-scripting-xss-protection]]
=== Cross-site Scripting (XSS) protection

[yada]#yada# also sets the `X-Xss-Protection` response header to
`1; mode=block`. This can be overridden in the resource model.

[source,clojure]
----
{:x-content-type-options "0"}
----

[[media-type-sniffing-protection]]
=== Media-type sniffing protection

By default, [yada]#yada# sets the `X-Content-Type-Options` response header to
`nosniff`. This tells browsers not to try to attempt to determine the
content-type of the response body.

Since [yada]#yada# sets the `Content-Type` header according to HTTP standards,
there should never be a need for a browser to 'sniff' the response body
for this information, preventing an attack that might exploit some
vulnerability in this process.
